## Integration Points

### With Existing Systems
- **AI Service Hook** integration for intelligent content generation
- **Settings System** integration for user preferences
- **Accessibility System** integration for inclusive design
- **Theme System** integration for consistent styling

### Usage Patterns
```tsx
// Basic tooltip integration
<WithSmartTooltip
  feature="devflow-studio"
  component="node-creation"
  title="Create Node"
  description="Add a new node to your workflow"
  quickTips={["Use Ctrl+N for quick creation"]}
  keyboardShortcut="Ctrl+N"
>
  <Button>Create Node</Button>
</WithSmartTooltip>

// Provider setup
<IntelligentHelpProvider>
  <YourApplication />
</IntelligentHelpProvider>
```

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **React Context** for global state management
- **Custom hooks** for help system integration
- **TypeScript interfaces** for type safety
- **Modular components** for flexible usage
- **Event-driven architecture** for user action tracking

### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy loading** of AI insights with delays
- **Memoized callbacks** to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Efficient state updates** using functional updates
- **Cleanup mechanisms** for memory management
- **Debounced AI requests** to prevent API spam

### Accessibility Features
- **ARIA labels** and descriptions for screen readers
- **Keyboard navigation** with proper focus management
- **High contrast** support for visual accessibility
- **Screen reader** announcements for dynamic content
- **Focus trapping** in modal interfaces
